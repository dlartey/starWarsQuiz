# A simple Star Wars Quiz made with JavaFX

This was originally coded in Eclipse IDE with Java version 8, but I have since migrated to using IntelliJ with Java version 15

The quiz has 5 questions in which you will have to guess the correct star wars character based on the picture. You will be presented your overall score at the end, by clicking the button to show it.


Requirements:
- JavaFX must be installed, so that the program can run
- Must have Java15 SDK on system
